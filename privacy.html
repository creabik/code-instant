We do not store any details about your calendar events. When you connect a video conferencing provider, we may create meeting rooms on your behalf and attach information for joining the conferencing session to CodeInstant events.</p>
                  <p>If you purchase a paid version of CodeInstant, our payment processor (Stripe) will collect and store your billing address and credit card information. You may find their <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">privacy notice here</a>.</p>
                  <h2 id="legal-basis-for-processing" tabindex="-1">Legal Basis For Processing</h2>
                  <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
                  <ol>
                  <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here to learn more.</li>
                  <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
                  <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.</li>
                  <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
                  <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                  <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with these laws. If you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">local data protection supervisory authority</a>.

                  <h3 id="your-account" tabindex="-1">Your Account</h3>
                  <p>In order to keep your Personal Data accurate and complete, you can log in to review and update your account information, including contact and billing information, via your account settings page. We will do our best to honor your requests subject to any legal and contractual obligations.

                  <h3 id="cookies" tabindex="-1">Cookies</h3>
                  <p>You may also refrain from providing or may withdraw your consent for Cookies via your browser settings. Your browser’s help function should contain instructions on how to set your computer to accept all Cookies, to notify you when a Cookie is issued, or to not receive Cookies at any time. Please keep in mind that Cookies are required to authenticate CodeInstant Users as well as perform some actions within CodeInstant (such as to pay for an event as an Scheduler via CodeInstant), so in order to use the Website, some Cookies are often required. For further information, see our <a href="/cookie-policy.html">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
                  <h2 id="security-measures" tabindex="-1">Security Measures</h2>
                  <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. More information on CodeInstant security and storage practices is available.</p>
                  <p>We take the security of your personal information very seriously. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from CodeInstant is at your own risk. You should only access CodeInstant within a secure environment.</p>
                  <h2 id="policy-regarding-children" tabindex="-1">Policy Regarding Children</h2>
                  <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using CodeInstant, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of CodeInstant. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at support@CodeInstant.com.</p>
                  <h2 id="do-not-track-features" tabindex="-1">Do Not Track Features</h2>
                  <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
                  <h2 id="dispute-resolution" tabindex="-1">Dispute Resolution</h2>
                  <p>Details regarding CodeInstant’s dispute resolution process are available in our <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
                  <h2 id="changes-to-this-notice" tabindex="-1">Changes to this Notice</h2>
                  <p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by a revised “Last updated” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information. If you continue to use CodeInstant after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised Notice.</p>
